This repo contains implementation for automating interactions with Canvas elements using Cypress. The tests are executed on the [LambdaTest cloud grid](http://www.lambdatest.com?fp_ref=himanshu15), but the same tests can also work with the respective test frameworks installed on the local machine.

Here are the overall usecases covered in the repo:

## Canvas Element Handling With Cypress

Automating [LambdaTest Bug Smasher](https://www.lambdatest.com/bug-smasher) game play with Cypress on the LambdaTest cloud grid. The automated game play also works seamlessly on Cypress installed on local machine (i.e. macOS Sequoia 15.1). The resolution & viewport size is set to 1024*768.

Follow the steps along to trigger the test execution:

**Step 1**

Create a virtual environment by triggering the *virtualenv venv* command on the terminal

```bash
virtualenv venv
```

**Step 2**

Navigate the newly created virtual environment by triggering the *source venv/bin/activate* command on the terminal

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Cloud Execution

**Step 3**

Procure the LambdaTest User Name and Access Key by navigating to [LambdaTest Account Page](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/security). You might need to create an an account on LambdaTest since it is used for running tests on the cloud Grid.

Set LambdaTest **Username** and **Access Key** in environment variables.

* For **Linux/macOS**:
  
```bash
export LT_USERNAME="LT_USERNAME" 
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="LT_ACCESS_KEY"
```
* For **Windows**:
```bash
set LT_USERNAME="LT_USERNAME" 
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="LT_ACCESS_KEY"
```

**Step 4**

For execution on LambdaTest, add the credentials (i.e. LambdaTest username & access-key) to the [following lines](https://github.com/hjsblogger/canvas-automation-selenium-cypress/blob/main/cypress-demo/lambdatest-config.json#L3).

**Step 5**

Now that the credentials are all set, trigger the command ```lambdatest-cypress run``` on the terminal to run Canvas element tests on LambdaTest.

Once the execution is triggered, navigate to the [LambdaTest automation dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/) to check the status of the tests.

Shown below is the snapshot of the test execution where the game play is automated using Cypress (on LambdaTest cloud grid):

As seen above, I scored 85 points in the game :) Not a bad attempt at all :D.

#### Local Execution

**Step 3**

You can run the same test on Cypress (local machine) with Chrome (headed mode) browser by triggering the command ```npx cypress run --browser chrome --headed``` on the terminal. Please note that the Canvas implementation might require changes if the tests have to be executed on a different browser (e.g. Firefox, etc.).

**Step 4**

Shown below are some screenshots from game play automated on local machine:
